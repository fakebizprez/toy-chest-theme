ICON CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

To complete the Toy Chest Theme, you'll need to create a colorful toy chest icon.

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: A colorful toy chest that incorporates the theme colors:
  - Deep navy blue (#23364a)
  - Bright green (#30cf7b)
  - Royal purple (#5f207a)
  - Red (#be2d26)
  - Yellow (#e7d74b)
  - Cyan (#41c3ad)

Design suggestions:
1. Create a simple toy chest with the lid open
2. Use the deep navy blue (#23364a) as the main chest color
3. Add colorful toys peeking out from the chest using the theme's accent colors
4. Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
5. Ensure good contrast for visibility in the VS Code marketplace

Once created, rename this file to "icon.png" and replace it with your actual icon image.
